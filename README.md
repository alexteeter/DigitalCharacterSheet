# DigitalCharacterSheet
A digital character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edtion

## Overview
A simple Python-based program that tracks all (most) of the stats and numbers needed for D&D, that's homebrew-agnostic, and pretty editable. This is a work in progress, but can get most characters through any campaign.
Using user-input, the program can create, save, load, and import characters. Save data for each character is stored locally in a human-editable .ini file for easy access.
This program is meant to supplement a paper character sheet, keeping track of numbers that change often, saving the user from erasing over and over.
## Requirements
Windows, for now.
### If running from .py or .bat
Program will require Python 3 or higher (available from the [Python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or the Microsoft Store).
Also you will need to install PySimpleGUI, which can be done using the Pip installer in the command prompt or PowerShell.
> pip install PySimpleGUI
### If running from .exe
Only Windows is needed.

## Use
Place executable in any clean folder, and click to run- that's it. I recommend making an installation folder just for the program, so the save files will be easy to find.
Upon first use, you will need to create (or import a character). The program will prompt the user for basic character stats (e.g. Name, Class, Ability Scores, etc.).
#### Note:
This project was made for my own DnD campaign and is worked on in my free time. Updates may be sporadic and based around issues and UI elements I come arcoss personally. If you use this software, feel free to leave any feedback.
